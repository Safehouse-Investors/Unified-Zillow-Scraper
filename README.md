## üîß Advanced Architecture Deep Dive

### **Unified Request Handling System**

The actor employs a sophisticated request routing system that intelligently handles different types of requests based on the selected mode and URL patterns. This unified approach eliminates the complexity of managing multiple separate actors while maintaining the specialized functionality of each.

**Request Type Classification**:
The system automatically classifies incoming requests into four categories: `SEARCH_PAGE` for processing Zillow search result pages, `ZIPCODE_SEARCH` for zip code-based property discovery, `COMPREHENSIVE_SEARCH` for combined discovery and extraction workflows, and `DETAIL` for detailed property information extraction. This classification enables the system to apply the appropriate extraction strategies and data processing pipelines for each request type.

**Dynamic Queue Management**:
The request queue dynamically adapts based on the selected mode and discovery settings. In comprehensive mode, the system automatically queues discovered properties for detailed extraction, creating a seamless pipeline from discovery to complete data collection. The queue management system includes intelligent deduplication to prevent processing the same property multiple times and priority handling to ensure efficient resource utilization.

### **Intelligent Property Discovery Engine**

The discovery engine represents a significant advancement over traditional single-strategy search approaches. By employing multiple search strategies simultaneously, the system maximizes property coverage and identifies opportunities that might be missed by conventional methods.

**Multi-Strategy Search Implementation**:
The discovery engine generates multiple search URLs for each zip code, targeting different market segments and property characteristics. This includes price-based searches for finding below-market opportunities, time-based searches for identifying motivated sellers through properties with extended market time, and characteristic-based searches for specific property types that often present investment opportunities.

**Discovery Mode Optimization**:
The system offers three discovery modes that balance comprehensiveness with efficiency. Basic mode provides single-strategy searches suitable for simple property discovery tasks. Enhanced mode employs multiple complementary strategies for broader market coverage while maintaining reasonable resource usage. Comprehensive mode activates all available discovery strategies, including specialized searches for distressed properties and market analysis across all price segments.

### **AI-Powered Selector Evolution**

The unified selector management system represents a breakthrough in automated web scraping technology. By combining traditional hierarchical selector strategies with advanced AI-powered generation, the system achieves unprecedented reliability and adaptability.

**Hierarchical Selector Architecture**:
The system maintains comprehensive selector hierarchies for both search result pages and property detail pages. These hierarchies are ordered from most specific to most general, allowing the system to first attempt highly targeted selectors before falling back to broader approaches. This strategy maximizes extraction accuracy while maintaining robustness against minor website changes.

**AI Integration and Learning**:
When traditional selectors fail, the system automatically engages GPT-4 to analyze the current page structure and generate appropriate selectors. This AI integration goes beyond simple fallback functionality - the system learns from successful AI-generated selectors and incorporates them into future extraction strategies, creating a continuously improving extraction capability.

**Performance Optimization Through Caching**:
The intelligent caching system stores successful selectors with URL pattern recognition, enabling rapid reuse across similar page structures. The cache performance monitoring provides detailed analytics on hit rates and selector effectiveness, allowing for continuous optimization of extraction strategies.

## üìà Performance and Scalability

### **Intelligent Concurrency Management**

The system employs sophisticated concurrency controls that adapt to the current operation mode and website response characteristics. This dynamic approach ensures optimal performance while respecting website resources and avoiding anti-bot measures.

**Mode-Specific Concurrency**:
Different modes require different concurrency strategies. Search and zipcode modes use conservative concurrency settings to avoid overwhelming search result pages, while details mode can employ higher concurrency for property detail pages which are generally more tolerant of parallel access. The system automatically adjusts these settings based on response times and error rates.

**Resource Allocation Optimization**:
The system includes sophisticated resource management that balances extraction speed with data quality. Memory usage is continuously monitored and optimized through automatic cleanup of unused selectors and performance data. Request queue management prevents overwhelming the target website while maximizing extraction efficiency.

### **Advanced Error Recovery Systems**

The multi-layer error recovery system ensures maximum reliability and data quality even when facing challenging extraction conditions.

**Selector-Level Recovery**:
When a specific selector fails, the system automatically progresses through the hierarchical selector list before escalating to AI-powered generation. This approach ensures that temporary failures don't immediately trigger expensive AI calls while maintaining the ability to adapt to structural changes.

**Page-Level Recovery**:
If an entire page fails to load or parse correctly, the system logs detailed error information and continues with other pages, preventing single failures from compromising the entire extraction process. The error logging includes context information that enables rapid troubleshooting and system optimization.

**Anti-Bot Mitigation**:
The system includes sophisticated anti-bot detection and mitigation strategies. When blocking is detected, the system implements appropriate delays, proxy rotation, and request pattern adjustments to restore access. The mitigation strategies are continuously refined based on observed blocking patterns and success rates.

## üîí Best Practices and Compliance

### **Respectful Scraping Implementation**

The actor is designed with deep respect for website resources and compliance with best practices for automated data collection.

**Rate Limiting and Resource Management**:
Appropriate delays between requests prevent overwhelming the target website's servers while maintaining efficient extraction speeds. The system includes intelligent request spacing that adapts to website response times and implements exponential backoff for failed requests.

**Proxy Management and Distribution**:
Built-in proxy support distributes requests across multiple IP addresses to avoid triggering rate limits while maintaining extraction continuity. The proxy management system includes automatic rotation and health monitoring to ensure optimal performance.

### **Data Quality Assurance**

**Comprehensive Validation Systems**:
All extracted data undergoes rigorous validation to ensure accuracy and completeness before being saved. The validation system includes format checking, range validation, and consistency verification across related data fields.

**Completeness Tracking and Optimization**:
The system continuously monitors extraction success rates and identifies patterns in missing data to optimize selector performance. This monitoring enables proactive identification of extraction issues and systematic improvement of data quality.

### **Privacy and Security Considerations**

**Contact Information Handling**:
Agent contact information is extracted only when explicitly requested and is handled according to data privacy best practices. The system includes configurable options for controlling the level of contact information extraction based on specific use case requirements.

**Secure Data Processing**:
All extracted data is processed through Apify's secure infrastructure with appropriate access controls and encryption. The system includes audit logging for compliance monitoring and security analysis.

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Low Success Rates**:
If extraction success rates are below expectations, first check the selector performance statistics in the output logs. Enable AI-powered updates if not already active, and review proxy configuration and rate limiting settings. The test mode provides detailed debugging information that can help identify specific extraction issues.

**Blocking and Access Issues**:
If the system encounters blocking or access denial, verify proxy configuration and reduce concurrency settings. Check the logs for anti-bot detection patterns and adjust request timing accordingly. The system includes automatic blocking detection and recovery, but manual adjustment of settings may be necessary for challenging websites.

**Data Quality Problems**:
For data quality issues, review the validation settings and extraction options in the configuration. Enable test mode for detailed debugging information and examine the sample output for patterns in missing or incorrect data. The keyword filtering settings may also affect the final data quality if too restrictive.

**Performance Optimization**:
To optimize performance, review the concurrency settings and adjust based on the specific requirements of your use case. Monitor cache performance statistics and selector effectiveness through the performance metadata. The discovery mode settings can significantly impact both performance and data coverage.

### **Advanced Debugging Techniques**

**Test Mode Analysis**:
Enable test mode for comprehensive debugging information including detailed error logs, selector performance statistics, and extraction timing data. This mode provides extensive diagnostic information that can help identify and resolve complex extraction issues.
